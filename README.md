## 📌 Description
During the COVID-19 lockdown, I created this model from scratch to analyze and forecast the outcomes of the 2020 MLB postseason. Prompted by an email about a bracket contest, I used Excel to develop a fully functional data scoring tool that assessed offensive and pitching performance across all playoff teams. The model featured custom power rankings, above-average stat flags, and comparative metrics to identify top-tier teams.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Rank MLB playoff teams based on key hitting and pitching stats.
- Flag teams with above-league-average performance.
- Generate a custom power score (*rtg*) for each team.
- Predict likely postseason outcomes.

## 🧠 Methodology
- **Input Data:** Manually entered team statistics from the 2020 season (shortened to 60 games).
- **Derived Features:**  
  - HR/game  
  - Runs/game  
  - Above-average count flag  
  - Custom power score (*rtg*)  
- **Analysis:** Compared model output to actual playoff results.

## 🏆 Results
- **100% accuracy** predicting Championship Series participants.
- **Dodgers (World Series winners)** and **Rays (AL Champs)** were ranked top 2 in the model.
- Identified top 4 teams with complete alignment to final outcomes.

## 🧩 Key Takeaways
- Strong instinct for **feature engineering** and **ranking logic**.
- Built without any formal analytics training.
- Marked the first time I created a model to bring order to chaotic data.

## 🔜 Next Steps
- Refactor in Python or Power BI.
- Add dynamic formulas for reusability.
- Publish as part of a broader analytics case study series.
